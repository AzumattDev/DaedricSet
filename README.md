# Daedric Set

Daedric weapons from Skyrim (with a few inspired by Skyrim, but not in the actual game!) More to come soon.

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`


## Information

Highly configurable damage values for each weapon, change the required crafting station and more! Everything can be found in the configuration file. Please note that all configuration options should live update, if you change them in the configuration file. (Including pre-crafted gear!)
